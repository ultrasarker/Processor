## Getting Started

This bot is in the process of a rewrite into the Rust language (from Node.js). The prefix for this bot is `/`. Yes, it's a slash (/), since slash commands are the future for Discord bots! Type `/help` to list all the categories of commands. You will need to set up the correct permissions for the bot. For your convenience, you may give this bot `Administrator` privileges as it resolves all permission conflicts with the bot.
